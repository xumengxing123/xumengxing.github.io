Hey xumengxing123!

A sign in attempt requires further verification because we did not recognize your device. To complete the sign in, enter the verification code on the unrecognized device.

Device: Chrome on Windows
Verification code: 698657

If you did not attempt to sign in to your account, your password may be compromised. Visit https://github.com/settings/security to create a new, strong password for your GitHub account.

If you'd like to automatically verify devices in the future, consider enabling two-factor authentication on your account. Visit https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication to learn about two-factor authentication.

If you decide to enable two-factor authentication, ensure you retain access to one or more account recovery methods. See https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods in the GitHub Help.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
